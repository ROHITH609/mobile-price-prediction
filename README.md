# mobile-price-prediction
Problem statement: Create a classification model to predict whether price range of mobile based on certain specifications
->At first we check any null values is there are not if any we will modify or remove
->Then visualization the data using differnt attribute which are correaltion to price attribute
->After we divide the data set into train and test data set
->Then we train the data using different models like
 a)Logistic Regression
 b)KNN Classification
 c)SVM Classifier with linear and rbf kernel
->find Confusion matrix and classification report for each of these models.
->Report the model with the best accuracy
